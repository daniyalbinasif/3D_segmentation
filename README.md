# 3D Segmentation
End-to-end pipeline for 3D medical image segmentation of the heart. Implements two augmentation strategies—geometric/intensity (flip, rotate, shift, jitter) and elastic deformation—trains 3D U-Net, and compares baseline vs augmented models using Dice, Hausdorff, sensitivity, and precision.
